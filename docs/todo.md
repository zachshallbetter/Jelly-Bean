Create the Floating Widget:
Implement the floating widget as an always-on-top Electron browser window.
Design the user interface for the widget based on the provided specifications and wireframes.
Implement the functionality for displaying recommendations and clipboard history in the widget.
Implement Text Event Listeners:
Implement event listeners to monitor text selection and input field focus events.
Trigger the display of relevant recommendations in the floating widget based on these events.
Implement Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
Use Electron's IPC mechanism to enable communication between the main process (CLI) and the renderer process (widget).
Define custom IPC channels for sending commands and data between the CLI and the widget.
Implement event handlers in both the main process and the renderer process to respond to IPC messages.
Connect CLI Commands to Widget Actions:
Implement logic in the CLI to send IPC messages to the widget based on user input.
For example, when the user enters the start command in the CLI, send an IPC message to the widget to show itself.
Similarly, when the user enters the quit command, send an IPC message to the widget to close itself.
Test the CLI and Widget Integration:
Test the CLI commands and verify that they correctly control the behavior of the widget.
Test the text event listeners and verify that the widget displays the correct recommendations based on user interactions.
